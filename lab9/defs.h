Matrices A, B, and C are stored in two dimensional arrays with
row dimensions that are greater than or equal to the row dimension
of the matrix.  This row dimension of the array is known as the
"leading dimension" and determines the stride (the number of
double precision numbers) when one goes from one element in a row
to the next.  Having this number larger than the row dimension of
the matrix tends to adversely affect performance.  LDX equals the
leading dimension of the array that stores matrix X.  If LDX=-1
then the leading dimension is set to the row dimension of matrix X.
